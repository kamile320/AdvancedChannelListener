Discord Bot that listens all possible channels on Discord - you'll see every message sent on channels where the Bot is.<br><br>

A.C.L. saves every message sent on Discord server to files in directories named as ID of Discord User who jus sent a message - with info about Server, Channel (and ID's of course). 
Bot also listens DM chats with him. Now you can know what is going on your Discord server and who's who. No more impersonating, hiding, etc.  
Everything works and creates automatically. Only thing you need to do - create Discord Application on Discord Developer Portal, fill .env file with important things and install python modules via setup.sh (see [ServerBot Manual](https://github.com/kamile320/ServerBot))

Based on: [ServerBot](https://github.com/kamile320/ServerBot) [v1.9.3](https://github.com/kamile320/ServerBot/releases/tag/v1.9.3)
